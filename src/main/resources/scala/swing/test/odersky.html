Being co-written by the language's designer, Martin Odersky, you will find it provides 
additional depth and clarity to the diverse features of the language. The book provides 
both an authoritative reference for Scala and a systematic tutorial covering all the features 
in the language. Once you are familiar with the basics of Scala you will appreciate having this 
source of invaluable examples and precise explanations of Scala to hand. The book is available from Artima.
