Steps in Scala
<br>
Introduction to Object-Functional Programming
</h1>
<p>by Christos KK Loverdos and Apostolos Syropoulos</p>
<p>
"In this book, the authors show how Scala grows to the needs of the programmer, 
whether professional or hobbyist. They teach Scala with a step-by-step approach 
and explain how to exploit the full power of the industry-proven JVM technology. 
Readers can then dive into specially chosen design challenges and implementation 
problems, inspired by the trials of real-world software engineering. It also helps 
readers to embrace the power of static typing and automatic type inference. In addition, 
the book shows how to use the dual-object and functional-oriented natures combined at 
Scala's core, and so write code that is less 'boilerplate', giving a genuine increase 
in productivity."
