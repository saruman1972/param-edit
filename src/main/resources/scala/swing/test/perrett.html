Lift In Action
</h1>
<p>by Timothy Perrett</p>
<p>

Lift in Action is a step-by-step exploration of the Lift web framework. Part one gives 
you a firm grounding in Lift concepts and introduces Lift (and Scala's) eco-system of 
tools. Throughout the course of part two, we will be building a sample application that
 covers most of the key concepts within the framework and shows you how to implement them. 
 Part three is an in-depth reference to all the components that make up Lift; from HTTP 
 dispatching through to sophisticated Comet and AJAX. This book is intended for users who 
 are new to both Scala and Lift, but should also provide valuable insights for developers 
 who are already using Lift in the wild.
