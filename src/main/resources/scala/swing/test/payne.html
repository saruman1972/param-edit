"Learn how to be more productive with Scala, a new multi-paradigm language for the 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that integrates features of both object-oriented and 
functional programming. With this book, you'll discover why Scala is ideal for highly 
scalable, component-based applications that support concurrency and distribution. You'll 
also learn how to leverage the wealth of Java class libraries to meet the practical needs 
of enterprise and Internet projects more easily."
